## Introduction
This is an open online course on network information hiding and network steganography. The course contains video material and slides of my class at the University of Hagen (*FernUniversität in Hagen*), Germany, and partially at some classes at *Hochschule Worms*.

In Hagen, this material belongs to course 01731 (*Network Steganography*), which forms a module together with course 01730 (*Introduction to Information Hiding*).

I also used (a part of) these slides at other universities, summer schools etc. over the years. I updated the content over the years and will continue to do so. I made sure that references are using links so that you can get easier access to the particular publications.

Please note that quite some content of this class is based on the book W. Mazurczyk, S. Wendzel, S. Zander, A. Houmansadr, K. Szczypiorski: [Information Hiding in Communication Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/7434879), WILEY-IEEE, 2016. If you are an IEEE member, you should be able to download the book for free.

### Chapter 1 - Introduction to steganography and covert channels
This chapter provides an overview of the whole class. Afterwards, fundamental terminology, taxonomy and history of information hiding will be covered. The chapter also highlights some use-cases (legitimate and criminal ones) and tells you a bit about the CUING initiative.

- **Exercise:**
	- Low-attention raising covert channels (such as described in the paper by Lalande and Wendzel above) are usually linked to a small bitrate. Explain why such channels can be considered valuable especially in network environments.
	- Given the rising trend of censorship circumvention, why do you think is Information Hiding not applied by a large number of people? (And who does actually apply it?)
	- The above-mentioned paper by Krätzer et al. proposes a "modern (post 2010) steganographic communication setup". Why did the authors introduce this model? How does it differ from the classical *prisoner's problem* that was covered in Chapter 1?

___

### Chapter 3 - Fundamental countermeasures (not network-specific)
In this chapter, you will learn how covert channels can be detected, eliminated, and limited on the basis of exemplary countermeasures. These countermeasures can be applied at different states of a system's lifetime (design-phase to operation phase). In particular, I cover the Shared Resource Matrix (SRM) methodology, Covert Flow Trees (CFT), Fuzzy Time, and the Spurious Processes Approach.

- **Exercise:**
	- Which method would you apply to eliminate/spot covert channels in the following situations:
		- The company you are working for wishes to get a certificate (e.g. a high level of EAL) for their product; the certificate requires a code-level audit that lists all possible covert storage channels.
		- You plan to design a new product (not implemented in code). You need to perform a covert channel analysis using the product’s specification.
		- Your company plans to sell a product to a military customer. The customer requires a covert timing channel audit, which you performed. However, the customer will only accept covert channels with a channel capacity below 1 bit/s.
	- How could you create a policy-breaking covert channel during your exam in order to secretly exchange answers to exam questions?
		- Link this scenario to the Prisoner’s Problem.

	- Can Information Hiding methods be applied to deduce cryptographic keys from encryption/decryption tools? If yes: how?
___

### Chapter 5 - Getting the big picture: hiding patterns
In this chapter, so-called *hiding patterns* are introduced. Patterns are a universal tool that is popular in software engineering and other disciplines, even outside of informatics. Hiding patterns are an easy way to describe and understand how data can be hidden using network covert channels. Instead of studying hundreds of separate hiding techniques, one can simply grasp all their core ideas using hiding patterns.
The second part of this chapter introduces a revised version of the patterns taxonomy that is not specific to the network context. Instead, it can be applied to *all* domains of steganography. This revised model was introduced in August 2021 and contains certain additional features, such as the distinction between *embedding* and *representation* patterns.

### Chapter 6 - Staying under the radar: sophisticated hiding methods and distributed hiding patterns
This chapter covers distributed hiding methods, including pattern variation, pattern hopping, protocol switching (protocol channels, protocol hopping covert channels), dynamic overlay routing for covert channels, micro protocols (covert channel internal control protocols, including their optimization), reversible data hiding (RDH), and dead drops that exploit network caches.

### Chapter 7 - Selected network-level countermeasures
Chapter 7 finally introduces methods to combat network covert channels. The chapter is separated into two parts. **Part A** covers selected basic methods, namely traffic normalization (preventing/limiting), three methods by Berk et al. and Cabuk et al. (detection of inter-packet times pattern), and finally, the so-called *countermeasure variation*. **Part B** introduces countermeasures that help limiting and detecting sophisticated network covert channels, namely the protocol switching covert channels and the NEL phase. These methods are the *protocol (switching covert) channel-aware active warden* (PCAW) and the *dynamic warden*.

### Chapter 9 - *OMG! I found a new hiding method. How do I become famous?!1!* a.k.a. How to describe a new hiding method in a paper?
When a new hiding technique is found, how should it be described in a way that other authors can easily access it? How to ease replication studies? How to ease the process of finding out what still needs to be done? These questions can be answered with the *unified description method* for network information hiding techniques explained in this chapter. Moreover do I introduce the *creativity metric* that helps to decide about the novelty of a research contribution.

### Chapter 10 - *My smart fridge does strange things …* a.k.a. steganography in the Internet of Things (IoT)
In the Internet of Things (and Cyber-physical Systems, CPS), data can either be hidden within network communications (e.g. in IoT protocols) *or* in can be hidden the CPS *components* (e.g. unused registers or states of actuators). I will discuss these methods as well as scenarios in this conference talk below. However, please note that the PDF files contain an extended scenario. I plan to update the PDF slides in the coming years as there is still quite a lot to say about this chapter.

BioSTAR workshop in late May, 2017 (IEEE Security & Privacy Workshops, San José, CA)

- **Exercise:**
	- What is the difference between an intentional covert channel and an intentional side channel in a CPS? Can you name a few examples? Both terms of CPS Steganography are introduced in [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229092563_Covert_and_Side_Channels_in_Buildings_and_the_Prototype_of_a_Building-aware_Active_Warden/link/00b495349285c92bbd000000/download). What was the solution proposed by this paper to combat both types of channels?
	- In [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6468400&tag=1), I describe how an MLS-based filtering can prevent covert and side channels in CPS network communications (exemplified using smart buildings). How does this work? What are limitations?

### Chapter 11 - Summary and overall conclusion
This chapter summarizes what we have learned in the ten previous chapters. I also highlight open research problems that might support you in finding topics for a Master or even a PhD thesis.

- **Reading Assignment:** none

- **Exercise:**
Congratulations, you made it through the whole class! **Now it is time for the final (big!) exercise!** Try to find a new network protocol for which there is absolutely no work available that analyzes covert channels in this protocol (use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) or any other paper search engine to find such works). Next, analyze the protocol regarding all known hiding patterns and describe all covert channels that you found using the unified description method. If you like, submit your paper to a conference (or: let me know and I can potentially link the paper at least here).
